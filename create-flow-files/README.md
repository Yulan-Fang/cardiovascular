# Create Average Flow Files

This program is used to create flow files from the converted simulation results files (.vtp or .vtu) created by the **svpost** program or the SimVascular **SV Simulation** plugin **Convert Results** options. It reproduces the code SimVascular uses to create the flow files when the **Calculate Flows** option is enabled.

The program creates the following files:

    all_results-pressures.txt - Pressure for each face with time steps
    all_results-flows.txt - Flowrate for each face with time steps
    all_results-averages.txt - The average, maximum, minimum values of presure, flowrate for each face
    all_results-averages-from_cm-to-mmHg-L_per_min.txt - Same info as in all_results-averages.txt, but pressure is in mmHg, flowrate is L/min.
    
## Building the Program ##

The program needs CMake and VTK to build. 

Install VTK 
   
    Ubuntu 18:  sudo apt-get install libvtk6-dev
    
Install CMake:

    Ubuntu 18:  sudo apt-get install cmake
    
    
To build the program executable:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

This creates an executable named **create-flow-files**.

## Program Options ##

The program takes the following options:

    --mesh-directory: The directory where the mesh surface files (.vtp) are located.,
    --output-directory: The directory to write the average flow files to.
    --results-directory: The directory of the converted simulation results.
    --single-file: Simulation results have been converted to a single .vtu file. (yes/no) 
    --skip-walls: Skip calculating averages for walls. (yes/no) 
    --units: Units (cm, mm)

All options must be given.

## Example ##

This is an example showing how to use the program to create the flow files for the **Cylinder Project**. It assumes that the simualtion results have already been converted in the **steady-converted-results** directory.

```
create-flow-files --mesh-directory $HOME/SimVascular/CylinderProject/Simulations/steady/mesh-complete/mesh-surfaces    --output-directory $HOME/create-flow-files/test  --results-directory $HOME/SimVascular/CylinderProject/Simulations/steady/4-procs_case/steady-converted-results  --single-file no --skip-walls yes  --units cm
```
